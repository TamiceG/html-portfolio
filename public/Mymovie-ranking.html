<h2>My top 3 scariest movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Candy Man</h3>
<p>I saw this movie when i was a little girl.<br />
I can condifdently say, never again will i watch it.
</p>
<br />
<h3>The Ring</h3>
<p>The concept of a little girl being able to harm people<br />
simply by looking at them and lets not forget she gives you<br />
"7 days" to live. Absolutley terrifying.
</p>
<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>I still remember seeing the trailer to this movie while<br />
sitting in a packed movie theater. The scream i let out during<br />
the clapping scene was so loud everyone in the theater including<br />
my sister laughed. </p>
